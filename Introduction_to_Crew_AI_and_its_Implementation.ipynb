            "CrewAI is a lean, lightning-fast Python framework built entirely from scratch—completely independent of LangChain or other agent frameworks.\n",
            "CrewAI empowers developers with both high-level simplicity and precise low-level control, ideal for creating autonomous AI agents tailored to any scenario:\n",
            "CrewAI Crews: Optimize for autonomy and collaborative intelligence, enabling you to create AI teams where each agent has specific roles, tools, and goals.\n",
            "CrewAI Flows: Enable granular, event-driven control, single LLM calls for precise task orchestration and supports Crews natively.\n",
            "With over 100,000 developers certified through our community courses, CrewAI is rapidly becoming the standard for enterprise-ready AI automation.\n",
            "​How Crews Work\n",
            "Just like a company has departments (Sales, Engineering, Marketing) working together under leadership to achieve business goals, CrewAI helps you create an organization of AI agents with specialized roles collaborating to accomplish complex tasks.\n",
            "CrewAI Framework Overview\n",
            "ComponentDescriptionKey FeaturesCrewThe top-level organization• Manages AI agent teams• Oversees workflows• Ensures collaboration• Delivers outcomesAI AgentsSpecialized team members• Have specific roles (researcher, writer)• Use designated tools• Can delegate tasks• Make autonomous decisionsProcessWorkflow management system• Defines collaboration patterns• Controls task assignments• Manages interactions• Ensures efficient executionTasksIndividual assignments• Have clear objectives• Use specific tools• Feed into larger process• Produce actionable results\n",
